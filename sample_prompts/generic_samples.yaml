      LONDON, England (Reuters) -- Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe gains access to
      a reported £20 million ($41.1 million) fortune as he turns 18 on Monday, but he
      insists the money won't cast a spell on him. Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter in
      "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix" To the disappointment of gossip
      columnists around the world, the young actor says he has no plans to fritter his
      cash away on fast cars, drink and celebrity parties. "I don't plan to be one of
      those people who, as soon as they turn 18, suddenly buy themselves a massive
      sports car collection or something similar," he told an Australian interviewer
      earlier this month. "I don't think I'll be particularly extravagant. "The things
      I like buying are things that cost about 10 pounds -- books and CDs and DVDs."
      At 18, Radcliffe will be able to gamble in a casino, buy a drink in a pub or see
      the horror film "Hostel: Part II," currently six places below his number one
      movie on the UK box office chart. Details of how he'll mark his landmark
      birthday are under wraps. His agent and publicist had no comment on his plans.
      "I'll definitely have some sort of party," he said in an interview. "Hopefully
      none of you will be reading about it." Radcliffe's earnings from the first five
      Potter films have been held in a trust fund which he has not been able to touch.
      Despite his growing fame and riches, the actor says he is keeping his feet
      firmly on the ground. "People are always looking to say 'kid star goes off the
      rails,'" he told reporters last month. "But I try very hard not to go that way
      because it would be too easy for them." His latest outing as the boy wizard in
      "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix" is breaking records on both sides of
      the Atlantic and he will reprise the role in the last two films. Watch
      I-Reporter give her review of Potter's latest » . There is life beyond Potter,
      however. The Londoner has filmed a TV movie called "My Boy Jack," about author
      Rudyard Kipling and his son, due for release later this year. He will also
      appear in "December Boys," an Australian film about four boys who escape an
      orphanage. Earlier this year, he made his stage debut playing a tortured
      teenager in Peter Shaffer's "Equus." Meanwhile, he is braced for even closer
      media scrutiny now that he's legally an adult: "I just think I'm going to be
      more sort of fair game," he told Reuters. E-mail to a friend . Copyright 2007

  description: "Solving a first-order linear differential equation."
  answer: |
    Step 1: Identify the form of the differential equation:
    dy/dx + 2y = e^(-2x).

    Step 2: Find the integrating factor (IF):
    IF = e^(∫2 dx) = e^(2x).

    Step 3: Multiply both sides by the integrating factor:
    e^(2x) * (dy/dx + 2y) = e^(-2x) * e^(2x).

    Step 4: Simplify and integrate:
    e^(2x) * dy + 2e^(2x) * y = 1.

    Integrate both sides:
    ∫e^(2x) * dy + ∫2e^(2x) * y dx = ∫1 dx.

    f'(x) = cos(x) - 1.

    The limit becomes:

    λ₁ = (3 + √(3² + 4*5)) / 2 = (3 + √29) / 2,
    λ₂ = (3 - √(3² + 4*5)) / 2 = (3 - √29) / 2.

    For λ₁ = (3 + √29) / 2:
    (A - λ₁I)v₁ = 0,
    where v₁ is the eigenvector.

    Substitute λ₁ and solve:
    [[-√29/2, -1], [3, -√29/2]]v₁ = 0.

    Solve the system to find v₁.

    For λ₂ = (3 - √29) / 2:
    (A - λ₂I)v₂ = 0,
    where v₂ is the eigenvector.

    Substitute λ₂ and solve:
    [[√29/2, -1], [3, √29/2]]v₂ = 0.
